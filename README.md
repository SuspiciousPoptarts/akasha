# üì¶ Neo - Akasha Rewrite
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98726245/216891610-6acbfb88-6da3-44c1-aadd-35a80f14009b.png)
Why? A rewrite was required to correct some serious project issues that made it extremely unwieldy to call ipc functions from inside a "page" due to being inside an <iframe>

## Parity Checklist
* Characters üèóÔ∏è
* Weapons
* Artifacts
* Materials
* Food
* Animals
* Enemies
* Theme-ing
* Linkables

## Goals
* [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/)-like G.O.O.D. db & management
* [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/)-like character optimization features
* Built-in OCR for character, weapon, and artifact scanning
---
## Differences

* "Page"-accents now apply to the sidebar
* "Pages" resize along with the viewport
* "Pages" are JS files that append to the viewport, not an iframe, which means IPC calls are actually possible
* Future-HoyoLab map implementation will either open a BrowserView overlay or just a new window
