# Building Akasha:

First, clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuspiciousPoptarts/akasha <your\dir>
cd <your\dir>
```
Then, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) dependencies with npm:
```bash
npm install
```
or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):
```bash
yarn
```

Then, generate the necessary JSON files:
```bash
node syncdata
```

Finally, build with [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder):
```bash
electron-builder
```
‚ö†Ô∏è if electron-builder is not a recognized command-line argument, install it via `npm i electron-builder --save-dev`

Inside `<your/dir>/dist` an `Akasha Setup <ver>.exe` will have been built, and *that* is your installer.
